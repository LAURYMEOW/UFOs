# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 

The purpose of this analysis was to update and improve Dana's website to provide a deeper analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter by multiple criteria at the same time while providing a more focused navigation.  

## Results: 

With the new filter added to the web page design, you can perform a more specific search that meets one or more criteria. The new filter options are city, state, country, and shape in addition to the date filter, of course.
Below you can see a couple of examples of how to filter by option.

This is what a three-criteria search looks like:
- state: florida 
- country:us 
- shape: fireball

It is important to clarify that the search is strict, that is, it must be with the words, spelling and format found in the table. Any difference with the original text will return an empty table.
Below you can see the result using uppercase for the filter in state.

-Instead of using fl, use FL

## Summary:

In general, the added filters make the web page more dynamic, attractive and user-friendly.
Improvements can still be made to make the website more professional and much easier to use.

- For example, you could consider using a less strict text matching filter to make the search easier.
Let's remember the aforementioned case of searching for the state of Florida with capital letters, obtaining an empty table as a result, even though there is data for that state.
This could cause confusion to the user and think that either the data does not exist or that the filters are not clear to do the search.

- Another detail would be to add an auto-fill function for the filter boxes, so that users know what data they have for each criterion. It is tiring to guess or scroll the data to do an advanced search.
